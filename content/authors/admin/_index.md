I am a Master student of Genomics & Bioinformatics at **Genomics & Disease Resistance Improvement Lab**, which located at **Oil Crops Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences**. My Master research work mainly focus on **Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of Rape Agronomic Traits Based on Population Structural Variation (SV)**. Currently, I am also interested in **Oilseed rape Omics Website Construction**, **Oilseed rape Pan-genome construction & analysis** and **Oilseed rape Genome SV Detection**.
